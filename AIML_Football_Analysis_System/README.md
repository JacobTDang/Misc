# AIML Football Analysis System

This project is an AI/ML-based system for analyzing football matches, leveraging advanced technologies for object detection, tracking, and video annotation.

## Technologies Used

- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: Pre-trained YOLO models (e.g., YOLOv8) for object detection and tracking.
- **Roboflow**: Used for dataset preparation, annotation, and augmentation.
- **OpenCV**: For video processing, frame extraction, and annotation.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Applied for color extraction and team assignment.
- **Python**: Core programming language for implementing the system.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For development, analysis, and experimentation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data and debugging outputs.

## Acknowledgments

- Roboflow for dataset preparation and augmentation.
- YOLO models for their robust object detection capabilities.
