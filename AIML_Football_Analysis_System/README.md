# AIML Football Analysis System

This project is an AI/ML-based system for analyzing football matches, leveraging python libraries and YOLO model and for object detection, tracking, and video annotation.

## Technologies Used

- **YOLOv8 model**: Pre-trained YOLO models for object detection and tracking, fine-tuned with images from RoboFlow.
- **Roboflow**: Used for dataset preparation, annotation, and augmentation.
- **OpenCV**: For video processing, frame extraction, and annotation.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Applied for color extraction and team assignment.
- **Python**: Core programming language for implementing the system.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For development, analysis, and experimentation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data and debugging outputs.

## Acknowledgments
- Roboflow for dataset preparation and augmentation.
- YOLO models for their robust object detection capabilities.
